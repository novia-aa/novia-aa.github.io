I am a Computer Science graduate student researching large language models, trustworthy AI, and physics-informed learning. My work spans Bayesian optimization for LLM fine-tuning and calibration, as well as meta-learning–enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Operators for fast PDE adaptation. My research aims to advance principled, scalable methods that connect theory with real-world AI systems.
